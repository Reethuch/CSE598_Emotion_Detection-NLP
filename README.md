Sentiment Analysis project done in CSE598:Deep Learning Course
DL_Final_Project.ipynb - This file consists of the model trained on BERT Encoder and BERT Sequential Classifier

DL_Final_Project_Task1.ipynb - This file consists of the model trained on BERtweet pre-trained model.

DL_Final_Project_Task2.ipynb - This file consists of Multi-task learning.

DL_Final_Project_Task3.ipynb - This file consists of the model trained for different sample sizes

DL_Final_Project_Task4.ipynb - This file consists of the model trained on glove embeddings and LSTM classifier to compare the computational budget.


How to run the file:

We have ran all the above files in google colab with gpu runtime. 
The process is pretty much straight forward we can start running from the top cell.
